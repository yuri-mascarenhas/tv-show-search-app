# TV Show App

## Overview

This project is a simple website designed for making searches about TV shows. The main objective is to enhance my understanding of making API requests using **Axios** .

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- **HTML5 (🌐):** Responsible for structuring the webpage.
- **CSS (🎨):** Provides styling to make the interface visually appealing.
- **JavaScript (vanilla) (💻):** Utilized for handling user interactions and making asynchronous API requests.
- **Axios (🚀):** A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the TV shows API.
- **TvMaze (📡):** A free TV Shows **REST API**
