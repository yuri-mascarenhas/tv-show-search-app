# TV Show App

## Overview

This project is a simple website designed for making searches about TV shows. The main objective is to enhance my understanding of making API requests using **Axios** .

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- **HTML5 (🌐):** Responsible for structuring the webpage.
- **CSS (🎨):** Provides styling to make the interface visually appealing.
- **JavaScript (vanilla) (💻):** Utilized for handling user interactions and making asynchronous API requests.
- **Axios (🚀):** A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the TV shows API.
- **TvMaze (📡):** A free TV Shows **REST API**

### API Usage

The TV Show App uses the [TV Maze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) to fetch information about TV shows. Please refer to the API documentation for more details on available endpoints and response formats.

## Features

- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for TV shows.
- **Display Results:** The app displays information about the searched TV show, such as title, summary, and other relevant details.
